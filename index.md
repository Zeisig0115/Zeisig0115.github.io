# About Me

<img src="/images/tianyou_li.jpg" class="floatpic">

I am **Tianyou Li** (李天佑).

Currently, I am a Research Assistant at Cornell University. I work with [Prof. David Bindel](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~bindel/), [Dr. Nate Cira](https://ciralab.bme.cornell.edu/), and [Dr. Jingjie Yeo](https://jingjieyeo.github.io/) on structure-aware **Gaussian Processes** and **Bayesian Optimization** with applications in material science and biomedical engineering.

I received my M.Eng. degree from [Cornell University](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/ece/), where I was advised by [Prof. Peter Doerschuk](https://doerschuklab.bme.cornell.edu/) on machine learning for **LNP characterization**. Prior to that, I obtained my B.Eng. degrees from the [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/electrical-engineering-and-electronics/) and [Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/study/departments/school-of-advanced-technology/electrical-and-electronic-engineering). During my undergraduate studies, I studied **NFC security** with [Prof. Junqing Zhang](https://junqing-zhang.github.io/) and **neuromorphic computing** with [Prof. Chun Zhao](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/ChunZhao/).

I am always open to academic discussions and potential collaborations. Please feel free to reach out to me at **tl899 [at] cornell.edu**.
