      I received my M.Eng. degree from <a href="https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/ece/">Cornell University</a>, where I was advised by <a href="https://doerschuklab.bme.cornell.edu/">Prof. Peter Doerschuk</a> on machine learning for LNP characterization. Prior to that, I obtained my B.Eng. degrees from the <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/electrical-engineering-and-electronics/">University of Liverpool</a> and <a href="https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/study/departments/school-of-advanced-technology/electrical-and-electronic-engineering">Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University</a>. During my undergraduate studies, I studied NFC security with <a href="https://junqing-zhang.github.io/">Prof. Junqing Zhang</a> and neuromorphic computing with <a href="https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/ChunZhao/">Prof. Chun Zhao</a>.
