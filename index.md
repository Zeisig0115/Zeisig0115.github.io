# About Me

<img src="https://caihanlin.com/caihanlin.jpg" class="floatpic">

Here is **Tianyou Li** (李天佑).

Currently, I am a Research Assistant at Cornell University. I work with [Prof. David Bindel](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~bindel/), [Dr. Nate Cira](https://ciralab.bme.cornell.edu/), and [Dr. Jingjie Yeo](https://jingjieyeo.github.io/) on structure-aware Gaussian Processes and Bayesian Optimization with applications in material science and biomedical engineering.

Prior to joining Cambridge, I worked on wireless networks and cybersecurity under the guidance of [Prof. Zhezhuang Xu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=iZ7LQRkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Dr. Meng Yuan](https://myuan27.github.io/). Additionally, I was honored to be selected as an outstanding undergraduate scholar at leading AI conferences, including AAAI 2024 and SIGKDD 2024.

I am always open to academic discussions and potential collaborations. Please feel free to reach out to me at **tl899 [at] cornell.edu**.
